## What are Live Resin Cannabis Concentrates?
Live resin, like distillate, is a type of cannabis concentrate. However,
compared to distillate, live resin is not as refined. This leads to live resin
retaining the characteristic, aromatic scent produced by the complex terpene
profile of the cannabis plant.

Live resin is sometimes confused with the similar-sounding “rosin,” or live
rosin. While live resin is produced with freezing-cold temperatures involved,
rosin, or live rosin, on the other hand, involves exposing parts of the
cannabis plant to extra-high heat and pressure in order to extract potent
resin from the plant.

Live resin is most notable among other cannabis concentrates, such as shatter,
for its high terpene content. 

## How do You Make Live Resin?

Two primary steps are followed to extract live resin from the cannabis plant:

1. First, the flowers harvested from the plant are promptly frozen to preserve
   the water content, terpenes, and the psychoactive and non-psychoactive
   compounds found in cannabis. (It is this first step that makes the resin
   “live”: the cannabis flowers are frozen to capture the alive state they
   were last in before they were harvested.)
1. Second, an extraction process is performed on the frozen flowers. Common
   extraction processes for making live resin include hydrocarbon extraction
   (like Butane Hash Oil extraction aka BHO) and solventless extraction. More
   importantly, the flowers remain frozen throughout the extraction process.

These two steps create the desired waxy, yellowish, flavorful product known as
live resin.

## How Do You Use Live Resin?

There are several ways to smoke and consume live resin, such as:

- Dabbing, which is the most popular way that live resin is consumed. For
  those unfamiliar with dabbing, dabbing involves applying a small amount of
  concentrate to a hot surface, usually using a dab rig with an electronic
  nail, or quartz banger. A nail or banger is heated by a torch or, in the
  case of an e-nail, by electricity. Using a dab tool, the live resin or
  similar cannabis concentrate is applied to the hot nail or e-nail,
  vaporizing the live resin so it can be inhaled. Between 315 and 400°F seems
  to be the preferred temperature for dabbing live resin.
- Vaping with a dab pen, which is a less common but more convenient way of
  dabbing. Dab and wax vape pens perform a similar function as a dab rig.
  However, instead of using a nail to heat up the cannabis concentrate, an
  oven built into the vaporizer or a set of coils are heated which vaporizes
  the concentrate.
- Vaping using a 510-thread cartridge + battery, for maximum simplicity.
  510-thread carts filled with live resin are compatible with easily-purchased
  510-thread batteries.
- Topping off flowers, which is fitting for those who prefer to consume their
  cannabis in a more traditional matter such as smoking out of a bong or pipe,
  or hitting a joint. This involves sprinkling bits of live resin onto your
  dry herb cannabis flowers.

## Is Live Resin Different from Wax, Shatter, and other Cannabis Concentrates?

Live resin, wax, and shatter, each generally have the same level of potency.
The real difference between these types of concentrates is texture,
appearance, and flavor. Prices for these products can also greatly vary.

- Live Resin comes in many textures, colors, and consistencies. The textures
  have names such as sugar (when the live resin looks like granulated sugar)
  and budder (a play-on-words of “butter,” when the live resin looks like
  butter). Live resin is typically regarded as the most high-end out of the
  three types of cannabis concentrates listed. It is also the most difficult
  to produce. As such, it commands a premium price, although many will say the
  expense is well worth it. Not all dispensaries and delivery services carry
  it, and it is considered a boutique product.
- Wax has a softer texture than live resin and shatter. This allows it to be
  consumed in many ways. But, because of its soft texture, wax breaks down
  rapidly and must be consumed more quickly than other concentrates. Wax is a
  popular cannabis concentrate and most dispensaries and delivery services
  keep it in stock.
- Shatter has a texture almost identical to glass. This glass-like texture
  allows shatter to be stored for a long period of time. The trade-offs are
  that shatter is delicate to handle and difficult to consume. Experienced
  cannabis consumers say that shatter is stronger than wax. Shatter can be
  purchased from most dispensaries and delivery services.

## Is Live Resin Considered a ‘Full Spectrum’ Extract?

> SO, THE CORRECT ANSWER TO THE QUESTION OF WHETHER OR NOT LIVE RESIN IS A
> FULL-SPECTRUM EXTRACT IS: IT DEPENDS ON WHO IS ASKED.

It is debatable whether or not live resin is a full-spectrum extract.

First, it is helpful to understand the difference between full-spectrum
extracts, broad-spectrum extracts, and isolate extracts.

### Full-spectrum Extracts

Cannabis concentrates that are considered to be a full-spectrum extract (also
known as a whole-plant extract) contain all of the constituents of the
cannabis plant. This includes:

- Cannabinoids
- Terpenes
- Flavonoids

### Broad-spectrum Extracts

The term broad-spectrum extract is, for the most part, used only when talking
about CBD cannabis concentrates. Broad-spectrum extracts try to retain as many
constituents of the cannabis plant as possible. However, THC is deliberately
removed. This goal is to reduce or eliminate the psychoactive effect of
consuming the broad-spectrum extract cannabis concentrate. Broad-spectrum
extracts usually contain 0.3% THC or less.

### Isolate Extracts

Isolate extract cannabis concentrates, in contrast to full-spectrum and
broad-spectrum extracts, try to eliminate all constituents of the cannabis
plant except for the cannabinoids. High-quality isolate extract cannabis
concentrates can be 98-100% pure cannabinoids. Many CBD products are made with
pure CBD isolate which contains zero amount of THC.

### So Why the Confusion?

On one hand, since it is frozen immediately after being harvested, live resin
can be considered to be a full-spectrum extract. It contains all of the
constituents of the whole cannabis plant since it is not dried and cured.

On the other hand, live resin can be considered to not be a full-spectrum
extract cannabis concentrate for the exact reason that it is not dried and
cured. The process of curing harvested cannabis causes new chemicals to be
produced. Since live resin is not dried and cured, it does not contain these
chemicals.

So, the correct answer to the question of whether or not live resin is a
full-spectrum extract is: it depends on who is asked.
