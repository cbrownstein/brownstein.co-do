# Public Clouds vs. Private Clouds

## What are public clouds?

Public clouds consist of shared IT resources, such as computing power
(servers), networking services, and data storage. Public clouds are the most
common type of cloud, and references in the IT world to “the cloud” usually
mean a public cloud.

With public clouds, resources are managed by a third party, known as a cloud
hosting provider.

Cloud hosting providers include Amazon Web Services, Microsoft Azure, Google
Cloud, and Oracle Cloud.

With public clouds:

### IT hardware costs can be avoided

Companies that use public cloud technology do not have to invest in IT
hardware such as servers and networking equipment. Further, companies using
public clouds do not have to spend substantial amounts of money building out
data centers in which to operate the IT hardware.

### Infrastructure maintenance is outsourced

With public clouds, companies do not have to maintain their own IT hardware
infrastructure. Maintenance is outsourced to a cloud hosting provider. The
cloud hosting provider ensures that all of the cloud resources remain
available to the company.

### Resources can be scaled up or down on demand

Public cloud resources can be scaled up or down as needed by a company.

When additional computing capacity is needed, servers can simply be “spun up”
on the cloud hosting provider. When the computing capacity is no longer
needed, the servers can be spun down.

With public clouds, companies pay only for the resources that they are
actually using.

### Reliability can be guaranteed

Public clouds are operated on enterprise-grade IT hardware located in data
centers all over the globe.  Geographical distribution helps to eliminate
single points of failure, ensuring high levels of availability of cloud
resources. In fact, most larger public cloud hosting providers offer
guaranteed service level agreements, or SLAs.

## What are private clouds?

Complementary to public cloud technology is private cloud technology.

Unlike public clouds, private clouds consist of IT resources that are under
the exclusive control of the company operating the private cloud. The IT
resources are not shared.

Private clouds are operated on company-owned IT hardware located on company
premises, or in data centers contracted to host the company IT hardware.

Private clouds offer:

### Great flexibility over hardware and software configurations

Companies that want to be able to fine tune their cloud for their specific
needs choose private clouds over public clouds. Compared to public cloud
technology, private cloud technology gives companies great flexibility over
hardware and software configurations.

### Sole control over company data

Private clouds allow companies to retain sole control over their data. This
means that companies know exactly how their data is being duplicated and
replicated. They know exactly how backups are being made and where the backups
are being stored.

Further, the sole control companies exercise over their data in a private
cloud helps to ensure the data remains private.

### Distributed and scalable resources

Similar to public clouds, private clouds allow IT resources to be distributed
and scaled.

With private cloud technology, IT infrastructure that has already been built
by a company can be distributed and scaled in a manner appropriate for the
needs of the company.

## What are the differences between public and private clouds?

The primary differences between public and private clouds are:

1. Who maintains the cloud IT hardware
1. Who controls the company data

### Maintenance of IT hardware

An important distinction between public and private cloud technology is that
with public cloud technology, the IT hardware on which the cloud operates is
maintained by the cloud hosting provider.

The downside of having a cloud hosting provider maintain the IT hardware is
that it can come at a substantial financial cost, factored into the price
charged by the cloud hosting provider.

Further, companies using a public cloud do not have input into the choice of
hardware being used to operate the cloud, as they would with a private cloud.

### Control over company data

When using a public cloud, company data is in the hands of the cloud hosting
provider. The cloud hosting provider is responsible for the safeguarding of
the data.

Should there arise some security vulnerability that allows another “tenant”
company on the public cloud to access data belonging to other cloud tenants,
company data could theoretically be compromised.

Since private clouds are entirely controlled by the company that owns the
cloud, there is no risk of another cloud tenant being able to access private
company data.

## Which is better: public cloud or private cloud?

It is impossible to say that a public cloud is better than a private cloud, or
that a private cloud is better than a public cloud. The answer is different
for each individual company.

Companies that operate primarily on the Internet, such as online retailers,
probably would benefit the most from using a public cloud. Online retailers
often do not make good use of the granular configuration that private cloud
technology allows. Further, much of the data used and generated by online
retailers is not confidential in nature and is sufficiently protected by the
security built into public clouds.

On the other hand: companies that work with highly sensitive data, such as
companies in the healthcare industry or finance industry, probably would
benefit the most from using a private cloud. In fact, some regulations might,
due to privacy concerns, prohibit data from being stored in a public cloud.
