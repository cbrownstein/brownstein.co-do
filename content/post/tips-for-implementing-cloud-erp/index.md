# Tips for Implementing a Cloud ERP Software Solution

## What is ERP software?

Enterprise Resource Planning software, more often referred to simply as ERP
software, is a business software solution used by companies to:

- Improve the efficiency of operations
- Boost employee productivity
- Perform in-depth analysis of company data

ERP software is able to provide its benefits primarily by centralizing company
data into a single computer database. By doing so, ERP software is able to
process company data as a whole rather than in fragments spread across
different departments.

## Why companies should implement a Cloud ERP software solution

ERP software solutions generally are developed to be either:

1. Hosted on premises on company-owned computer servers
2. Hosted in the Cloud on servers owned by a Cloud hosting provider

For virtually all companies, regardless of the industry in which the company
does business, a modern, Cloud-based ERP software solution is preferable to
traditional, on-premises ERP software.

Here are a few benefits that Cloud-based ERP software offers compared to
on-premises ERP software:

### Lower upfront costs

With Cloud-based ERP software solutions, companies do not have to make a
significant upfront investment in expensive IT hardware. The IT hardware
needed to run the ERP software is owned and maintained by the Cloud hosting
provider.

With ERP software developed to be run on-premises, companies need to invest in
enterprise-grade servers and other IT hardware, including networking equipment
and storage solutions. Further, there is the ongoing expense of maintaining
this hardware.

### Accessible worldwide

Cloud-based ERP software solutions are built from the ground up to be
accessible over the Internet. They are hosted in the Cloud, which means the
ERP software can be used from anywhere in the world where an Internet
connection is available.

Traditional, on-premises ERP solutions are not designed to be used over the
Internet. As a result, to make the ERP software available to employees working
remotely, companies must implement cumbersome technologies such as virtual
private networks (VPNs).

### Easily scalable resources

In the contemporary business world, demand can change rapidly. Companies using
ERP software need to be able to scale resources easily and quickly in response
to changes in demand.

Computing resources for Cloud-based ERP software can be scaled up or down with
just a few mouse clicks or keystrokes. For example, additional data storage
space can be added instantly when existing storage space is running low.

With on-premises ERP software, to scale up resources, additional IT hardware
must be purchased. If additional data storage space is needed, hard disk
drives (HDDs) or other storage devices will need to be purchased, installed,
and configured.

## Tips for ERP software implementation

Companies looking to get started with a Cloud-based ERP software solution are
wise to follow these tips:

### Carefully develop an ERP software implementation plan

Like with any other important business project, a comprehensive plan should be
developed before the ERP software implementation process begins.

While there does not exist a single correct way to develop an ERP software
implementation plan, most ERP software implementation plans will include the
following phases:

1. **Discovery**, to understand the goals of implementing ERP software.
1. **Planning**, to determine what tasks need to be completed in order for the
   goals of implementing ERP software to be achieved.
1. **Development**, to tailor the ERP software and processes specifically for
   the company implementing the ERP software.
1. **Testing**, to work the bugs out of the ERP software solution
   configuration.
1. **Deployment**, to put the ERP software into active daily use by company
   employees.
1. **Support**, to make sure employees are able to take advantage of all of
   the benefits that ERP software has to offer.

### Create a team responsible for carrying out the ERP software implementation plan

ERP software implementation is best handled by a dedicated team. This team
should take full ownership of the responsibility to make sure the ERP software
implementation plan is properly and fully executed.

The ERP software implementation team should include employees who will be
using the ERP software on a daily basis. These employees know best what is
needed out of the ERP software solution and what functionalities in the ERP
software would be beneficial.

### Establish realistic time frames

When implementing ERP software, it is important that milestones, and time
frames for achieving the milestones, be established. These milestones and time
frames must be realistic.

One common reason why companies experience trouble when implementing ERP
software solutions is because “feature creep” sets in, that is, features keep
being developed and added, resulting in the project never being completed.

### Be patient to realize all of the benefits of using ERP software

Cloud-based ERP software solutions can significantly transform business
operations. Ultimately, these transformations will result in higher efficiency
and productivity. But, it can take employees a while to get familiar with an
ERP software solution.

Patience should be exercised before positive results from implementing ERP
software are seen.

### Work with ERP software implementation experts

ERP software implementation experts can help to ensure that an ERP software
implementation goes as smoothly as possible.

Experts at implementing ERP software, such as S-Metric, have the experience
needed to successfully guide companies through all phases of an ERP software
implementation plan.
