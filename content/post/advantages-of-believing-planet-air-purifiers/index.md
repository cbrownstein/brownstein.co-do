## Believing Planet air purifiers were designed in direct response to COVID-19

The ongoing COVID-19 pandemic has forced many people to remain indoors as much
as possible. While the lock-downs might be helping people from becoming
infected with the COVID-19 coronavirus, the lock-downs also have the
unfortunate side effect of causing people to be exposed to more indoor air
pollution.

Indoor air pollution exists in many forms, such as ordinary dust, smoke from
cooking, and fumes from cleaning sprays and other chemicals. Being inside all
the time causes more exposure to these pollutants.

By using a Believing Planet air purifier, you are creating a safer, healthier
indoor environment to live and work in.

## Believing Planet air purifiers use only true HEPA filters

Believing Planet air purifiers use only true High Efficiency Particulate Air
filters, or HEPA filters.

Some air purifiers are advertised as using “HEPA-type” filters.

But, only true HEPA filters are tested and proven to be able to remove at
least 99.97% of dust, pollen, mold, bacteria, and other airborne particles
with a size of 0.3 microns.

## Believing Planet air purifiers come with reliable customer support

Every member of the Believing Planet customer support team is well-trained,
knowledgeable, and educated in the use and maintenance of Believing Planet air
purifiers.

Should you have any questions regarding your Believing Planet air purifier,
our customer support team is standing by and ready to help.

## Believing Planet air purifiers are competitively priced

Believing Planet air purifiers provide an excellent value for their quality
and efficiency.

Cheaper air purifiers are often poorly manufactured and are not tested to
perform as advertised.

Believing Planet air purifiers, on the other hand, use only true HEPA filters,
which have been tested and proven to be able to eliminate smoke, fumes,
bacteria, viruses, and other particles from the air. 

## Believing Planet air purifiers are friendly for the environment

Believing Planet air purifiers are designed to eliminate indoor air pollution
without using an excess amount of energy or creating a bunch of waste.

And, unlike some other air purifiers such as ozone generators, Believing
Planet air purifiers do not produce any chemicals that could be harmful to
plants and animals.
