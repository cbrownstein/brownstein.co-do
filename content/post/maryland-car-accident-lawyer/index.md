# Maryland Car Accident Lawyer

Motor vehicle collisions are distressing for everyone involved. You have to
worry about short-term and long-term injuries. You have to worry about how
you’re going to afford repairing or replacing your vehicle. You have to worry
about medical bills piling up and the loss of wages and other income.

If you’ve been involved in a car crash or other motor vehicle accident, you
should speak with an experienced Maryland car accident lawyer to help you
navigate the difficult process of making an insurance claim, and to ensure you
receive the most compensation possible from your accident.

Experienced Maryland car accident lawyers have plenty of experience dealing
and negotiating with insurance companies, healthcare providers, body shops,
and all other parties to a personal injury case.

When you hire a Maryland car accident lawyer, your legal rights are protected
and you won’t be pressured into settling your case for less money than the law
entitles you to.

## Compensation Available After a Car Accident

Whenever someone is involved in a car accident or other collision involving
motor vehicles, various forms of compensation, also known as damages, become
available. This is true even if the person involved was speeding, ran a red
light or stop sign, was talking on their cell phone, was driving without a
license, or didn’t have insurance at the time of the accident.

Damages available to someone involved in a car accident can include:

- Physical injuries
- Pain and suffering
- Emotional distress
- Loss of present wages, salary, and other income
- Loss of future ability to earn income
- Present and future medical expenses
- Cost of repairing or replacing the vehicle and other personal property
- Cost of renting a vehicle
- Loss of companionship and quality time with family

In some cases, if the accident resulted from particularly egregious or
criminal behavior, such as street racing or high-speed pursuit, a court can
award an additional amount to punish the bad behavior, known as punitive or
exemplary damages.

## Process for Handling a Car Accident

The process for handling a car accident case often involves many parties, such
as insurance adjusters, investigators, law enforcement, doctors, surgeons,
chiropractors, physical therapists, body shops and mechanics. Maryland lawyers
who handle personal injury cases are used to working with all of these
parties, and are familiar with the process to make sure everything goes
smoothly.

Whenever someone is involved in a motor vehicle collision, they should seek
immediate medical attention. Even light-impact collisions can cause injuries
that aren’t noticeable, such as concussion, internal bleeding, and whiplash.

Once hired, a Maryland personal injury lawyer will help their client to open a
claim with the appropriate insurance carriers. The lawyer will present the
strongest evidence and arguments possible to persuade the insurance carriers
into paying the maximum amount possible. The lawyer will emphasize the best
points of their client’s case, such as the severity of the client’s injuries,
and will downplay any negative points of the client’s case, such as if the
client was using a cell phone when the car accident occurred.

Most car accident and vehicle collision cases in Maryland settle outside of
court without a lawsuit needing to be filed. But sometimes, a lawsuit might
need to be filed. If, for example, the client and lawyer are convinced that
the insurance carriers aren’t offering as much money as the client deserves, a
lawsuit might need to be filed. In the event that a lawsuit might need to be
filed, the lawyer will give their client the best possible advice on how to go
forward.
