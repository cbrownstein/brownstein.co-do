## What is a termite?

Termites are a type of insect that mostly feed on dead plant material and
cellulose, often in the form of wood, dead leaves, soil, and animal feces.
They are well-known for the damage they cause to buildings, crops, and
forests.

Termites are prevalent in all continents except for Anatartica.

Like ants, termites live in colonies that can range in size from a few hundred
to several million individual termites.

Termite queens are one of the longest-living insects on Earth, having a
lifespan that can be as long as 50 years.

## 10 Signs of a Termite Infestation

If you see any of these following 10 signs, you might be dealing with a
termite infestation:

1. **Mud paths (or mud tubes).** Termite mud paths, also known as termite mud
   tubes, are tunnels about the size of a pencil that can be found around
   termite nests, wood structures, and concrete or stone foundations. Termites
   construct these tunnels using soil, wood, saliva, and feces, and use them
   to navigate around.
1. **Frass.** Frass is a beige or black sawdust- or sand-looking material
   excreted by termites that consume dry wood. Drywood termites, once they
   build their nests in wood, do not leave. However, they push their droppings
   out of their nests, which form visible frass.
1. **Hollow-sounding wood.** Wood that sounds hollow or empty can indicate the
   presence of termites. The wood literally has been hollowed out by termites
   who have eaten the wood as food.
1. **Flying termites.** Termites that fly are also known as swarmers. These
   swarmers are adult reproductive termites. Occasionally, they develop within
   a termite colony and fly out of the nest to mate and start new colonies.
1. **Tunnels in wood.** Tunnels that termites leave in wood are responsible
   for the hollow or empty sound heard when wood consumed by termites is
   tapped. While some (subterranean) termites fill the holes they dig with
   soil, other (drywood) termites leave the holes empty.
1. **Water damage to drywall.** What appears as water damage to drywall can
   actually be damage caused by termites. While termites do not actually
   consume drywall, they do consume the paperboard, which can create faint,
   traceable lines that can be seen from the outside of the wall.
1. **Bubbling wallpaper.** Termites can also be responsible for bubbling and
   peeling wallpaper. When termites eat through wallpaper, they cause the
   wallpaper to deform, creating bubbling and peeling. The bubbling and
   peeling can also be a result of the underlying drywall or wood being
   damaged by termites.
1. **Discarded insect wings.** Insect wings by closed windows and doors can be
   indicative that termite swarms have entered a structure. Termite swarms
   that have left the nest to mate will, once they land, shred their wings
   since the wings will no longer be needed.
1. **Quiet clicking sounds.** If a noise that sounds like quiet clicking can
   be heard, termites might be nearby. The quiet clicking sounds are caused by
   soldier termites banging their heads against wood to alert the colony of
   possible danger.
1. **Doors and windows are becoming tough to open.** Wooden doors and windows
   can become tough to open if they are being eaten by termites. As termites
   eat through wood, they leave behind moisture, which can cause door and
   window frames to warp and become uneven.
