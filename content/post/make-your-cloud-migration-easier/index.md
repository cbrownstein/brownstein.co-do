Migrating from on-premises IT solutions to the cloud is a daunting task in
itself.

Add on the responsibility of maintaining your existing legacy IT
infrastructure at the same time and that’s where sleepless nights and
headaches start to come into play.

It is easier to have someone else help you maintain your existing on-premises
IT hardware while you concentrate on your cloud migration.

Fortunately, Reliant Technology is here to ensure your migration from
on-premises IT solutions to the cloud goes smoothly.

## Challenges of Migrating to the Cloud

### Less Resources are Available to Maintain Existing IT Hardware

Although you are focused on transitioning to the cloud, that doesn’t mean that
your existing IT hardware no longer needs to be maintained. Most companies put
all of their resources toward transitioning to the cloud, failing to properly
maintain your existing IT hardware which results in costly downtime for your
organization.

### Timelines are Proving to be Unworkable

Often when migrating to the cloud,
unforeseen issues can cause a cascade of missed deadlines. These delays can
contribute to extra stress and extra costs. This makes the planning process
that much more important. Add additional times for unscheduled issues that
might occur.

### Budgets are Proving to be Inadequate

When unforeseen issues arise during a cloud migration, budgets can be overrun
with expenses not planned for. Having to adjust your budgets for these
unplanned-for expenses can result in constraints on the resources you would
rather dedicate toward your migration.

### Maintenance Contracts are not Properly Tracked

Since your attention is primarily being focused on your cloud migration, it is
easy to lose track of your maintenance contracts for your existing IT
hardware. When maintenance contracts are not being tracked properly, you might
overlook the need to renew them. Or, you might be in the precarious position
of having to procure one without have time to negotiate prices and terms.
