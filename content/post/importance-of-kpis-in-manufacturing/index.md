## What is a KPI?

In the manufacturing industry, the term “KPI” refers to a **Key Performance
Indicator**.

KPIs are defined metrics that manufacturing companies monitor and analyze in
order to make sure that critical business objectives are being met
successfully.

By monitoring and analyzing KPIs, manufacturing companies are able to gain
valuable insight into whether or not organizational goals and targets are
attained effectively. Further, KPIs can be used to help identify opportunities
to improve. Easily learn the strengths and weaknesses of your manufacturing
process. One of the
[benefits of a cloud ERP solution](https://info.cloud9erp.com/blog/benefits-of-true-cloud-erp-for-discrete-and-batch-manufacturing)
is it’s KPI tracking abilities. 

KPIs commonly monitored and analyzed in the manufacturing industry include:

- **Throughput**: The average rate at which a machine is capable of producing
  units. For example, a machine capable of producing 1,000 units per day would
  be said to have a throughput of 1,000 units per day.
- **Capacity utilization**: The amount of output produced by a machine
  compared to the amount of output the machine is capable of producing. For
  example, a machine producing 500 units per day, when the machine has the
  capacity to produce 1,000 units per day, is operating at 50% capacity
  utilization.
- **Availability**: The uptime of a machine compared to the total amount of
  uptime and downtime of the machine. For example, a machine that is producing
  output 23 hours out of the day, and is down for maintenance or other reasons
  1 hour out of the day, has an availability of roughly 96%.
- **Yield**: The number of good units (units meeting specifications) produced
  by a machine, out of the total number of units produced by the machine,
  including defective units. For example, a machine that produces 5 defective
  units for every 100 units produced, has a yield of 95%.
- **Scrap**: The amount of waste or rejected material that remains after a
  production run. For example, if 1,000 pounds of raw material is used in the
  manufacturing process, and 100 pounds of that material is discarded, 1% of
  the material is scrap.

Thanks to significant advancements in Business Intelligence and Executive
Information Systems, manufacturing companies can easily make powerful use of
KPIs.

## How to Identify KPIs in Manufacturing

Rather than try to keep track of all metrics generated in the manufacturing
process, manufacturing companies need to focus on those metrics that provide
the most valuable insight, that is, the key performance indicators (KPIs).

Manufacturing companies can determine their KPIs by first determining what are
the measurable (quantitative, versus qualitative) objectives of the company.

For example, an objective of a manufacturing company might be to reduce the
cost of each produced unit. In order to work toward toward this objective, the
company would want to track and analyze KPIs such as:

- Yield, to make sure that the amount of good output versus bad output is
  maximized
- Scrap, to make sure that the minimum amount of raw material ends up as waste

## Why You Need to Track and Measure KPIs

Tracking and measuring KPIs is crucial in order for your manufacturing company
to remain competitive in the industry. Tracking helps identify recurring
[manufacturing trends](https://info.cloud9erp.com/blog/2020-manufacturing-industry-trends). 

If you are not keeping track of your KPIs, you will not be able to evaluate
the effectiveness of your manufacturing operations. You will not be able to
measure where progress is being made in your production processes and,
conversely, you will not be able to measure where regressions are occurring.

By tracking and measuring KPIs, your manufacturing company will be better able
to identify shortfalls in its processes and be better able to develop and
implement optimizations.
