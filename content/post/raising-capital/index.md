# Raising Capital

## Introduction

One of the leading reasons that new businesses fail is because they run out of
sufficient capital to continue operating.

**Capital**, in the business world, refers to the assets a business
accumulates over time that it uses to continue its operations.

Regardless of whether you are running a business that sells products, or a
business that provides services, it is imperative that your business always
maintain sufficient capital.

In this video, we discuss:

1. Why it is important to have enough capital

## What capital is

It is commonly believed that capital consists only of the money in the bank
accounts of a business. Depending on who you ask, that might be true.

Others will say that, in the business world, capital includes more than just
money in the bank. Capital can also include items such as:

- Revolving credit
- Lines of credit
- Equipment

Well-trained and skilled employees are sometimes considered to be “**human
capital**.”

What all of these items have in common is that they are assets used by
businesses to operate.

We will stick mainly to the common understanding of capital as referring only
to financial assets, such as deposit accounts. But, at times, we will also
talk about other types of capital.

## Why it is important to have enough capital

Capital allows business operations to remain stable and to continue without
interruption. Further, having enough capital allows businesses to grow and
expand into new markets.

Businesses use capital for different purposes, such as:

- Paying for everyday, ongoing expenses
- Purchasing new equipment and maintaining existing equipment
- Expanding operations into new locations
- Acquiring operations from other businesses

## What can happen if a business does not have enough capital

Not having enough starting capital, or running out of capital after operations
have already commenced, can mean an early death for a business.

It is not uncommon for new entrepreneurs to underestimate the amount of money
they need to get their business up and running. New entrepreneurs also tend to
inaccurately forecast the amount of time it will take to begin making sales
and bringing in the revenue necessary for sustaining their business.

Also, new entrepreneurs oftentimes run into the pitfall of not having enough
cash on hand to weather unplanned events, such as loss of or damage to
inventory, or an involuntary closure of their business.

Running out of **working capital**, or money needed to pay current debts or
liabilities, can result in a cascade of negative consequences for a business:

- Bills stop being paid, so vendors and suppliers end their relationships with
  the business.
- Since vendors and suppliers have ended their relationships with the
  business, it is difficult or impossible for the business to stock inventory
  needed to fill customer orders.
- Since customer orders are not being filled, customers are taking their
  business elsewhere.
- Since customers have taken their business elsewhere, sales revenue can no
  longer cover operating expenses.

Ultimately, running out of working capital will lead to the demise of the
business.

## Different types of capital

Now that it is clear the undesirable sequence of events that can happen if a
business does not have enough capital, let us talk about the different types
of capital and how they can be acquired.

Financial capital is typically broken down into two categories:

- Equity capital
- Debt capital

### Equity capital

**Equity capital** refers to the investment of cash into a business by the
owner of a business and also by outside investors. In return for the
**contribution** made by the outside investor, the investor receives an
ownership stake in the business, known as **equity**.

The primary benefit of equity capital is that the owner of the business does
not guarantee that the investment will be repaid. However, that does not mean
the business owner is free to spend the investment money as they please.

When a business owner receives money from an outside investor, the business
owner owes a **fiduciary duty** to the investor. This means that the business
owner must use the investment money in a way that benefits the business.

The upside for an investor making an equity capital investment is that if the
business is a success, the investor can realize an unlimited **return on
investment**, or **ROI**. Compare this with debt capital, which we discuss
later, where the investor receives a fixed return on investment in the form of
**interest**.

To illustrate why an investor would want to contribute cash into a business in
return for equity:

According to a
[Forbes article](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexkonrad/2017/02/02/snap-ipo-means-big-windfall-for-early-snapchat-investors/),
in 2012, Australian investor Jeremy Liew contributed $485,000 to Snap, the
company that owns the social media app, Snapchat. Five years later, that
investment made by Liew was worth about $2.5 billion.

The downside for a business owner financing their business with equity capital
is that equity capital can be quite costly:

Liew, in return for his $485,000 investment in Snap, received an 8.6% equity
stake in Snap. Only the founders of Snap, Evan Spiegel and Bobby Murphy, owned
more of Snap than Liew.

Although Liew received a substantial windfall from his investment in Snap,
there was also the possibility that his investment would become completely
worthless.

Investors contributing capital to a business in return for equity expect to be
rewarded for the risk that they are taking.

If a business owner wants to obtain capital without giving up any ownership
stake in their business, then the business owner should look to debt capital.

### Debt capital

**Debt capital**, in contrast to equity capital, does not require a business
owner to give up any ownership stake in their business. Investors who provide
capital in the form of debt, meaning that they are loaning money to the
business or extending credit to the business, are repaid in the form of
interest. **Interest** is an amount paid to the investor in return for the
loan or credit they extend, typically specified as an **annual percentage
rate**, or **APR**.

Unlike with equity capital, when a business owner receives debt capital from
an investor, the business owner is guaranteeing that the money will be repaid.
If the money is not repaid, then the investor can file a lawsuit or take other
action to get their money back.

Many times, when an investor makes a loan to a business or extends credit to a
business, the investor takes a security interest in assets belonging to the
business. When an investor takes a **security interest** in the assets of a
business, the investor acquires the right to take possession of and sell the
business assets if the business fails to make its payments.

Security interests act as assurances to an investor that their loan or
extension of credit will be repaid.

The upside for investors who contribute debt capital is that they are
guaranteed a return on their investment.

The downside for investors is that, even though the business guarantees
payment on the investor, repayment is not truly guaranteed.

If the business is performing poorly, the debt capital investor might have to
renegotiate terms with the business owner. For example, the interest rate
might have to be reduced. Or, payments might have to continue for longer than
originally contemplated.

If the business is performing very poorly, or fails entirely and files for
bankruptcy, the debt capital investor might only receive back a portion of
their investment, or possibly nothing at all.

The luxury retailer Neiman Marcus, for example, filed for bankruptcy in 2020.
According to
[Bloomberg](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-05-07/neiman-marcus-luxury-dreams-were-shaken-by-debt-and-disease),
as part of its bankruptcy, Neiman Marcus will give up control of its
department stores in return for a reduction of its debt obligations from about
$5.5 billion to $1.5 billion.

Every business is unique and business owners need to decide for themselves
what type of capital is best for their business: equity capital, debt capital,
or a mixture of both.

Once the decision has been made, the business owner needs to actually raise
capital.

## How to raise capital

Raising capital is, admittedly, not a simple task, especially for new and
small businesses. Investors face a greater risk investing in new and small
businesses than they do with businesses having an established history of
providing a return on investment.

Still, there are a variety of ways new and small businesses can obtain equity
and debt capital. Here are a few examples:

### Self-funding

Self-funding, sometimes known as **bootstrapping**, refers to funding of a
business by the business owner themselves.

When a business owner bootstraps their business, they have complete control
over how the business operates. They are free to run the business as they
please.

Further, when a business owner bootstraps their business, they alone enjoy all
of the profits and rewards of having a successful business.

Business owners who have bootstrapped their business should be highly
motivated to lead their business to success. They have skin in the game,
meaning that they lose their investment should the business not work out.

In order to bootstrap their business, business owners might need to:

- Obtain a personal line of credit from their bank
- Put business expenses on personal credit cards
- Work a part-time job or do freelance work to earn extra money

Self-funding, or bootstrapping, should always be the first choice for raising
business capital, as it does not obligate the business owner to others.

### Government grants and loans

Business owners should search for government grants and loans available to
raise capital for their business.

As an example of a government grant program:

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the City of Los Angeles and County of
Los Angeles, together with various philanthropists, established the
[LA Regional COVID-19 Recovery Fund](https://www.lacovidfund.org/).

As part of the LA Regional COVID-19 Recovery Fund program,
[grants](https://www.lacovidfund.org/grants) were given out to businesses of
all sizes, from micro-entrepreneurs, to small businesses making between $1
million and $5 million.

Although the LA Regional COVID-19 Recovery Fund program is no longer giving
out grants, it will be offering
[flexible loans](https://www.lacovidfund.org/loans) to micro-entrepreneurs and
small businesses.

Government grants and loans are an attractive source of capital for business
owners:

- Grants do not have to be repaid, and they do not require business owners to
  give up any equity in their business.
- Loans typically have below-market interest rates and can sometimes be
  forgivable, meaning the business owner does not have to repay the loan if
  the business is not working out.

### Crowdfunding

Capital through crowdfunding might be available, depending on the type of
business being operated.

With **crowdfunding**, customers pool their money together and invest that
money into a startup business. The startup uses that investment as capital to
begin developing and producing a product. In return for their investment, the
customers receive the product once it is completed.

Crowdfunding is viewed as being an alternative type of capital, since it does
not require a business owner to give up equity or pay back a loan. Rather, the
business owner becomes obligated to develop, produce, and deliver a finished
product to the investor-customers.

### Friends and family

Finally, and arguably the least desirable way of raising capital, is
soliciting investments from friends and family.

The benefit of looking to friends and family for capital is that it is more
likely to be obtained than from other sources of capital. Moreover, the
investment terms will probably be better than the terms outside investors are
willing to offer.

Friends and family know you better than outside investors and financial
institutions ever will. They know your particular set of skills, your work
ethic, and your ability to accomplish goals.

The investments that friends and family are willing to make into your business
can be based on your reputation and credibility, rather than on just your
finances.

Although soliciting investments from friends and family might sound like an
attractive way of obtaining capital, the capital comes at a very heavy price:
should the business not work out, important, meaningful, long-lasting
relationships can be destroyed.

## Conclusion

In this video, we have gone over what capital is, why it is important to
businesses, and how it can be raised. This knowledge can be used by business
owners to make sure their business has the capital, and uses the capital,
needed to make their business a success.
