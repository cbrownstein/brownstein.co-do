## Better consumer choices lead to a better world

Oftentimes, we don’t put much thought into the products we purchase and use
daily. We choose our products based on what delivers the best value. We buy
what works for us.

But, many of us don’t take a moment to think about the impact our purchases
have on our forests, on our air, on our water, and on the rest of our
environment.

It’s time that we start rethinking our shopping behaviors and start asking
ourselves: what changes can we make to help save our trees and preserve our
Mother Earth?

Changing what we purchase can save the environment and, at the same time, save
us money.

## Three products you should immediately stop using, and what you can replace them with:

### 1. Traditional toilet paper

According to The World Counts, an organization formed to raise awareness of
important challenges faced around the globe, 42 million tons of toilet paper
is used annually.

In terms of trees: the National Geographic Society Newsroom reported in 2010
that the equivalent of 27,000 trees in toilet paper waste ends up being
flushed down the pipes or dumped in landfills every single day.

Instead of using traditional toilet paper for your bathroom needs, consider
using bamboo toilet paper.

Unlike traditional toilet paper, bamboo toilet paper is:

- Friendlier on the environment
- Impressively comfortable
- Delightfully soft, but thick at the same time
- Both highly absorbent and durable

### 2. One-time-use paper towels

Before you go out and buy another roll of paper towels, consider these facts
published by Creighton University:

- Most paper towels are manufactured from virgin paper and contain no recycled
  content
- No less that 17 trees and 20,000 gallons of water are required to produce a
  single ton of paper towels
- Paper towels are brightened with highly toxic chlorine and oxygen bleaches

Next time you have a spill that you need to wipe up, or some cleaning chores
that you need to perform, think about using reusable, washable products that
create less waste than paper towels. For example:

- Microfiber cleaning cloths
- Cotton napkins

Not only are these products better for the environment, they save you money by
not needing to be replaced constantly.

### 3. Disposable coffee filters

That coffee filter you trash with every fresh pot of coffee you brew might
seem insignificant. But repeated daily (multiple times daily, if you’re a
heavy coffee drinker), the paper waste generated quickly adds up.

It’s not just trees that are harmed by the widespread use of disposable coffee
filters. Disposable coffee filters are treated with chlorine and oxygen
bleaches, as well as other chemicals, to give them their white, clean
appearance. All of these chemicals can be harmful to fish, plants, and
wildlife, as well as to humans.

Instead of disposable paper coffee filters that are only good for one use then
need to be discarded, you should look into other options, like eco-friendly
washable and reusable metal and cloth coffee filters.

By substituting your disposable paper coffee filters with washable and
reusable metal and cloth coffee filters, you’re helping to keep our forests
lush, our fauna thriving, and our flora abundant.

## Just a little effort on your part can make a huge difference to the planet

It doesn’t take much to help make the world we live in a better place. Simple
changes to our daily routines and to our purchasing habits as consumers can
make an extraordinarily large positive impact on our environment.

When deciding what products to purchase, we should be thinking not just about
financial costs, but also costs to the environment. In many cases, we’re not
being backed into choosing one or the other. Saving the environment can also
mean saving money.

Next time you’re shopping for products that you incorporate into your daily
routine, be mindful of the planet and consider if eco-friendly options are
available.
