# Top Ways to Make Your Video Surveillance More Secure

Companies that value the protection of their premises must implement multiple
layers of security, including employment of trained security personnel and
maintenance of an Identity and Access Management (IAM) system.

One crucial component of a multi-layer approach to security is the
installation of a modern video surveillance system.

When the entrances and exits of company offices, warehouses, and other
facilities are covered by a modern video surveillance system, companies can
more easily detect trespassers and unauthorized persons from entering the
premises. The surveillance system can also help companies detect if property
is being removed from the premises without permission.

In many cases, the visible presence of a modern video surveillance system
deters illegal conduct from occurring in the first place.

Video surveillance systems, in addition to being a key component of security,
help companies ensure safety by allowing hazards such as fires and leaking
water to be noticed and addressed more quickly.

In order to be most effective, it is important that video surveillance systems
themselves be secure. An unsecure system might allow attackers to:

- Entirely disable the surveillance system
- View both live and previously saved video
- Spread viruses and malware to other devices on the network

Here are 5 top ways you can protect your surveillance system from hacking and
other attacks that can render a surveillance system ineffective:

## Change Default Passwords Immediately

It is common for video surveillance hardware to be configured with default
passwords, typically printed on labels on the devices themselves, or in the
manuals accompanying the devices.

Unless the default password of a device is changed, an attacker with physical
access to the device can easily look at the label to learn the password and
later illicitly access the device. If the default password appears in a
manual, an attacker might easily be able to locate the password online.

To prevent an attacker from exploiting default passwords programmed into a
video surveillance system, make sure immediately upon installation to change
default passwords to unique strong passwords composed of letters, numbers, and
other characters.

## Limit Network Access to the Surveillance System

Video surveillance systems should always be operated on a network separate and
apart from the main (production) network utilized by a company. This can be
accomplished physically, by using segregated network equipment. Or, this can
be accomplished using technologies such as virtual LANs (VLANs).

Should the video surveillance system need to be Internet-accessible, it should
always be behind a properly configured firewall and restricted to VPN access.

## Promptly Install All Software/Firmware Updates

Software and firmware updates should be installed as soon as they are
released. While vendors sometimes release updates to simply add functionality
or improve user experience, many updates are released to fix bugs that hackers
can potentially exploit to gain access to the video surveillance system.

If an automatic update feature is available, it should be enabled so that
important software and firmware updates are not overlooked, which could give
an attacker an opportunity to gain unauthorized access to the video
surveillance system.

## Block USB Access to the Video Surveillance Hardware

USB access to video surveillance hardware should be blocked except when it is
absolutely necessary.

Video surveillance hardware usually has a USB port that allows firmware
updates to be installed from a USB stick, or to allow video to be saved
directly to an external hard drive. Unless the USB port is being used to
install a firmware update or for another critical purpose, it should be
blocked physically or by disabling it in the device settings.

Determined attackers can develop or obtain exploits for the surveillance
system hardware that can be installed using the USB port. Once installed, this
rogue software can be difficult or impossible to detect, and could spread to
other parts of the video surveillance system network. And, if the video
surveillance system shares the company production network (which is
ill-advised, as discussed above), computers and servers can be infected as
well.

## Routinely Inspect Hardware for Signs of Tampering

Signs of tampering include:

- Loose or missing screws
- Removed labels
- Damaged cables

If any of these or other signs of tampering are observed, a trained technician
should be called immediately. Equipment that has been tampered with could
reduce the effectiveness of the surveillance system, or even cause the system
to fail entirely when it is most needed.
