Is the cannabis that you’re consuming lab tested? If not, it definitely should
be.

Read more to find out why.

## Why Does Cannabis Need to be Lab Tested?

Professional lab testing ensures the potency and safety of cannabis products
whether they be flowers, edibles, or concentrates like cannabis oil vape
cartridges and dabbing extracts.

If you’re buying recreational or medical marijuana, the only real way to know
the quality of what you’re consuming is through analytical testing.

### Lab Testing for Cannabis Potency

As part of professional lab testing, the potency of a cannabis product is
evaluated by measuring:

- The amount of THC in the product
- The amount of CBD in the product
- The ratio of THC to CBD in the product

While many compounds make up a particular cannabis strain’s terpene and
cannabinoid profile, these are the primary cannabinoids required to appear on
a certificate of analysis (COA) according to California regulations. 

Testing of potency is important because consumers seek different effects from
cannabis products.

Some cannabis users desire a high from their product. Products containing a
large amount of THC are probably best for these particular users.

On the other hand, some medical cannabis users want to avoid the high effect.
They desire alternative medicinal benefits from their cannabis products. These
users are typically better off with a product that has a high CBD to THC
content. Others may want pure a CBD product.

Users that want a pure CBD product that is free of any THC will definitely
want to turn to something like industrial hemp-derived CBD products and CBD
isolates. The purity of CBD in these products should be tested to show less
than 0.3% THC, backed by a reputable lab’s certificate of analysis.

By accurately testing potency, labs help to ensure consumers get the desired
effects from their choice of cannabis products. When you understand how much
THC is in your products, you can properly dose to avoid getting too high.

### Cannabis Lab Testing for Safety

In addition to evaluating the potency of cannabis products, professional labs
also run pesticide screening and test the safety of the product.

Using different technologies, labs will test for, among other possible
contaminants:

- Pesticides, such as glyphosate, boric acid, and DDT
- Solvents, such as butane and propane
- Mold, such as Cladosporium and Botrytis
- Bacteria, such as E. coli and Penicillium
- Heavy metals, such as lead and mercury

Further, professional labs will identify whether or not a cannabis product
contains the controversial additives propylene glycol (PG) and polyethylene
glycol (PEG).

## How Cannabis Lab Testing Works

Professional labs use a handful of complex, high-tech instruments and pieces
of equipment in order to run a comprehensive battery of tests on cannabis
products. 

The two primary methods of testing are gas chromatography (GC) and
high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC).

### Gas chromatography (GC)

Performed with a device called a gas chromatometer, gas chromatography (GC) is
used to analyze terpene profiles of cannabis products and detect the presence
of pesticides and residual solvents.

GC works for volatile substances, which are substances that are capable of
being vaporized. But, not all substances are capable of being vaporized.

GC is also used to determine the potency of cannabis products, by measuring
the levels of THC and CBD in the product.

The lab report must specify the percentage of the following cannabinoids for
each tested sample:

- THC
- THCA
- CBD
- CBDA

Further, the lab report needs to indicate the percentage of total THC and
total CBD.

### High-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC)

High-performance liquid chromatography, or HPLC, is a complementary test to
GC, discussed above.

HPLC works for substances that cannot be vaporized, but are soluble, that is,
capable of being dissolved.

Like GC, HPLC is used to determine terpene profiles and detect pesticides and
residual solvents in cannabis products.

SC Labs has a great guide on their website that explains how to interpret lab
results and understand the COA.

## Lab Testing Regulations for Licensed Brands in California

Regulation of the legal sale of cannabis products is left up to each
individual State. At the Federal level, cannabis is still illegal and,
therefore, is not regulated by the United States Government.

In California, one of the biggest States to legalize the sale of cannabis, the
legal sale of cannabis products is regulated by the Bureau of Cannabis Control
(BCC). 

As of January 2021, the BCC requires all cannabis products to be tested for
the following:

- Cannabinoids
- Pesticides
- Microbes
- Terpenoids
- Mycotoxins
- Heavy metals

The BCC has established thresholds that determine whether a sample test passes
or fails.

For example, with respect to the heavy metal “mercury”: the sample of an
inhalable (smokeable) good passes if the mercury content of the sample is 0.2
micrograms or less per gram.

For other, non-inhalable cannabis products, the test passes if there is 3.0
micrograms or less per gram.

If a sample from a product batch fails, the batch cannot be sold.

Depending on the product, additional testing might be required. For example,
edible cannabis products are required to be tested for homogeneity, that is,
that the contents of the product are uniform throughout the product.

In Colorado, another large State that has legalized the sale of cannabis, the
legal sale of cannabis is regulated by the State Licensing Authority of the
Colorado Department of Revenue, Marijuana Enforcement Division.

The testing requirements in Colorado, compared to the testing requirements in
California, are much more stringent. 

In addition to the substances required to be tested for in California, listed
above, Colorado also requires cannabis products to be tested for:

- Vitamin E acetate
- Polyethylene glycol (PEG)
- Medium-chain triglycerides (MCT)
- And other substances…

## Requirements to Start a Cannabis Testing Lab

Starting a cannabis testing lab is far from being a simple process.

First, as is the case when starting any business, many comprehensive plans
need to be developed and put in writing. Some examples of these plans include:

- Overall business plan
- Operational plan
- Marketing plan

Second, financing will need to be obtained in order to get the business off
the ground.

Will the cannabis testing laboratory be financed by investors? By borrowing
money?

Many banks and other financial institutions will not loan money to businesses
in the cannabis space.

Investors in a cannabis testing lab, or in any legally-operating cannabis
business, can expect to be thoroughly background checked. When government
officials are conducting these background checks, they will be looking for
criminal convictions, lawsuits, and other evidence that suggests the investor
lacks good moral character.

Third, after writing up business plans and obtaining financing, the “cannabis
part” of opening up the testing lab can begin.

The requirements for starting a cannabis testing lab are very complex and vary
from state to state.

In California, the Bureau of Cannabis Control (BCC) will require and need to
approve, among many other things:

- facility design plans
- lab operations plans
- lab quality assurance plans
- standard operating procedures (SOPs)

Only after the BCC has given its stamp of approval can the cannabis testing
lab start accepting new customers.

Yet, like any other business, there is no guarantee that the cannabis testing
lab will bring in money. Unfortunately, the pursuit of a profit leads some
labs to produce fraudulent test results.

## Reputable Testing Labs

Almost all cannabis testing labs are reputable and provide accurate test
results. The reality is, however, there are some labs that do not provide
reliable test results. This might happen innocently. But, it might also happen
maliciously.

The cost to build a cannabis testing lab with the most precise,
state-of-the-art equipment, can easily cost $500,000 or more. In order to
avoid that substantial cost, some labs will instead purchase older-generation,
less sensitive equipment.

Because older equipment is less sensitive than newer equipment, the test
results, while produced with the best intentions, are not always reliable.

Some labs are willing to fudge or fake test results because it is hard for
legitimate cannabis testing labs to be profitable. It is not uncommon for
cannabis testing labs to be $500,000 or more for equipment, but only be
testing 3 or 4 samples per day, at a cost of $100 or less per sample. Since it
is impossible for the lab to be profitable operating this way, the lab will
accept payments (in essence, bribes) to provide passing tests.

Steep Hill Labs and SC Labs are two of the leading cannabis testing labs in
the U.S. Other cannabis labs that produce trustworthy, valid test results are
ISO/IEC 17043 accredited. Labs that meet ISO/IEC 17043 have demonstrated that
their equipment is properly calibrated to internationally-recognized
standards. 

Further, labs that meet ISO/IEC 17043 have demonstrated that they competently
perform sampling, testing, and regular calibration of lab equipment.

As the cannabis industry continues to mature, more states will legalize
cannabis and impose stricter testing regulations. This is ultimately a great
step forward as it leads to increased transparency and consumer safety.

Are your favorite vape brands lab tested? When in doubt, ask for the lab
results. Be an educated cannabis user and know what you’re consuming.
