**Why anyone would want to own a French Bulldog is beyond me.**

If my girlfriend's "Frenchie" is even slightly representative of the French
Bulldog breed as a whole, you can expect your Frenchie--if you decide to own
one of these canine abominations:

- to tear up your trash the moment you leave your home
- to cry and whine whenever you're not near it
- to uncontrollably fart throughout the night
- to become overly excited and randomly bite kids
- to not follow a single one of your commands
- to pee and crap all over your carpet and floors

I'm up right now at 4 in the morning writing this article because my
girlfriend's French Bulldog--Leila--got into the trash earlier and for the
last few hours has been blowing out shit.

Leila's shit isn't solid enough to pick up with a poo-poo bag. But at the same
time, it isn't quite liquid enough where it could be blotted up with a paper
towel. Pretty much whatever you try to do to clean it up just makes the
situation worse.

Right now Leila is in her crate where she continues to shit. And pee. On all
of the crate walls. And on the ceiling, somehow.

This'll be fun to clean in the morning.

What redeeming qualities do French Bulldogs have? Absolutely none.

_Frenchies are a terrible dog._ They probably [shouldn't even
exist](https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/new-study-illustrates-the-sad-state-of-french-Bulldogs/).

Why all this crap? Because she's cute? WeHo trendy bullshit with Frenchies.
Look cute in public, horror at home.

All this being said, please don't buy or adopt a pet unless you're really sure
you're willing to care for it. Just because your kids want one, don't do it.

If I haven't given you enough reasons why you shouldn't get a French Bulldog,
it might be worth you while to read [Why French Bulldogs (and Their Owners)
Are the Worst: A
Rant](https://www.villagevoice.com/2015/12/08/why-french-Bulldogs-and-their-owners-are-the-worst-a-rant/).
