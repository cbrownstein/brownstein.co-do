**Why would anyone want to own a French Bulldog?**

You can expect your Frenchie:

- to tear up your trash the moment you leave your home
- to cry and whine whenever you're not near it
- to fart uncontrollably all day and all night
- to become overly excited and randomly bite kids
- to not follow a single one of your commands
- to pee and crap all over your carpet and floors

What redeeming qualities do French Bulldogs have? Absolutely none.

_Frenchies are a terrible dog_. These canine abominations [shouldn't even
exist](https://www.iflscience.com/plants-and-animals/new-study-illustrates-the-sad-state-of-french-bulldogs/).

They're not cute. They're not loyal.
