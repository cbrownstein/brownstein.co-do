## What is a Bed Bug?

Bed bugs are a relatively common type of insect known for the fact that they
feed on human blood, usually at night. They are prevalent throughout the globe
and the number of infestations has been increasing. The increase in the number
of infestations is believed to be a result of more traveling, more sales and
purchase of used furniture, and greater resistance to pesticides.

Bed bugs are notorious for their extreme difficulty to completely eliminate
once an infestation has begun. One of the reasons why they are so difficult to
eliminate is because they can live up to 70 days without feeding.

In order to stop a bed bug infestation, several treatments are used, typically
in combination:

- Heating the room where bed bugs are present to 122+ degrees Fahrenheit for
  90 minutes or more
- Vacuuming often
- Washing clothes at high temperatures
- Application of different pesticides

## What Does a Bed Bug Look Like?

Adult bed bugs are light brown to reddish-brown in color. Their bodies are
flat and oval in shape, and can grow to be about a quarter inch in length and
a tenth of an inch in width.

Immature, or nymph, bed bugs are translucent and lighter in color than adult
bed bugs. They become browner as they moult and reach maturity.

Bed bugs are commonly mistaken for tiny cockroaches or carpet beetles.
However, unlike cockroaches and carpet beetles, bed bugs move like ants when
they are warm and active. Further, when crushed, bed bugs release a
recognizable foul odor.

Bed bugs might be present if any of these signs can be observed:

- Blood stains on pillowcases or sheets
- Unpleasant odors on bedding and clothing
- Rusty-colored spots on walls, caused by bed bug feces

## What Do Bed Bug Bites Look Like?

Bed bug bites most often appear on exposed skin that is not usually covered at
night by sheets or blankets: arms, shoulders, legs, feet, face, and neck.

Bed bug bites do not always produce symptoms. However, when they do produce
symptoms, the bites usually appear as red, itchy dots on skin. They can be
accompanied by inflammation surrounding the bites and other signs including:

- Painful burning sensations
- Raised itchy bumps with clear centers
- Blisters

## Where to Look for Bed Bugs?

Bed bugs like to hide in places where people generally are or are near in the
nighttime. Some examples of these places are:

- Mattresses and boxsprings
- Couches and other furniture
- Behind electrical switch and outlet covers
- Folded sheets, blankets, and comforters

In addition to these places, bed bugs can sometimes be found in luggage,
backpacks, and in seat cushions, such as those in cars, buses, and trains. Bed
bugs transported by hiding in places like this can be spread to new areas and
cause fresh infestations.

## Hire a Bed Bug Exterminator

Due to their extreme resiliency, only professional bed bug exterminators are
capable of eliminating a bed bug infestation and prevent it from spreading.

As international travel has become more frequent, bed bugs are brought from
all over the world, especially from countries that have high rates of bed bug
infestations. Bed bugs from different countries respond differently to
different pesticides. Pesticides that are effective against bed bugs from one
region might not be effective on bed bugs from another region.
