Hi! My name is [Cody Brownstein](https://keybase.io/cbrownstein). I've created this site to:

- showcase the [various content](/tags) I've written for clients
- experiment with the [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) static site generator
- share my thoughts and feelings on myriad topics

Since this site is a constant work in progress, expect it to break--often.

This site is hosted _gratis_, courtesy of
[Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/c734c24d9785).

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/codybrownstein/) and
