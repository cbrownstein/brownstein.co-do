Hi! My name is Cody Brownstein. I've created this site to:

- showcase the content I've written for clients
- practice using the [Hugo static site generator](https://gohugo.io/)
- share my thoughts and feelings on myriad topics

Since this site is a constant work in progress, expect it to breakâ€”often.

This site is hosted _gratis_, courtesy of
[Digital Ocean](https://m.do.co/c/c734c24d9785). Using Digital Ocean's
[App Platform](https://www.digitalocean.com/products/app-platform/), this site
is built from the source code in my [GitHub
repository](https://github.com/cbrownstein).
